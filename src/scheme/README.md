# Scheme SMP

A McVitie-Wilson approach implemented in Scheme.  

Runs with `(stableMatching "list_employers.csv" "list_students.csv")` after having set up the scheme environment & after having loaded the file (TODO) 

Student preferences: `list_students.csv`
Employer preferneces: `list_employers.csv`

Also creates a new CSV file containing the matches.
